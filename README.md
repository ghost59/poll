A very simple concept for a voting system. It submits a voting poll which allows people to vote on the topic at hand. Which the user can change whenever they want. It creates a column that has four text, two of the text boxs you fill in using the textfields. Then when you use add, it will take the textfields value and add it to the poll. I have made a video to show this in action.  You will need python installed but all you should need to do is python main.py and it should run fine. Run within the vscode so that it installs all required dependences.
